# Type Casring
# there are two type of type casting...
# --->explicit type casting
# --->implicit type casting

# explicit type castin
# Explicit type conversion is performed by the user by explicitly using type conversion functions in the program code
a = "1"
b = "2"
print(int(a)+int(b))

# output --> 3

# implicit type castin
# Implicit type conversion is performed by a Python interpreter only.
a = 1
b = 2.5
print(a+b);

# output --> 3.5
